# RAW Crop
This is a repository for sharing the code and reports for the DA231 MTech (Online) class project.

Our goal is to find the correlation between literacy, rainfall, groundwater quality and crop production across India.

It is intuitive that good rainfall is conducive to good production. How do the regions perform during poor rainfall in the rainy season?

We also want to cross match with the literacy rate of the region to see if higher levels of literacy affects crop production.

The project struture is as follows:
<pre>
root
  |- code : Contains the iPython files exported from Google Colab
  |- data : Contains all the data which is used for running the code

</pre>
